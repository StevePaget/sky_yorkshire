# Yorkshire Sky Colours @sky-yorkshire

## This is a bot that takes pictures of the sky and analyses the colours it finds. Then it tweets a small square of the average colour of the sky at that time, along with a name for that colour.

The bot runs on a [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/), using a [standard camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/)
